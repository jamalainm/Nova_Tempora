# Nova Tempora Nova Mores

This is a Latin port of Evennia! I'm trying to prevent too much corruption of the original files, so I have made copies of them with Latin names, which could be very confusing for people who don't speak Latin!

## Typeclasses
1. characters = persōnae
2. exits = exitūs
3. objects = rēs
- I've reworked a lot here to accommodate the differences of language
4. rooms = locī

## Commands
1. commands = iussa_latīna
- drop = relinque
- get = cape
- give = da
- look = spectā
- say = dīc
